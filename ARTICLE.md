## Why This Interests Me

This methodology fascinated me because it provides clear guidelines for building 
modern web applications that are scalable and maintainable. The twelve principles 
cover everything from codebase management to deployment practices.

What I find most valuable is how these factors address real-world problems I've 
encountered in projects. The emphasis on configuration management and treating 
backing services as attached resources makes cloud deployment much more reliable.

## Key Principles

- Keep dependencies explicit
- Store config in environment variables
- Treat logs as event streams
