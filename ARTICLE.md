## What I find interesting

What I find really interesting about this article is that it dicusses how vibe coding has become increasingly prevalent in workspaces. This allows for jobs to work more effeciently and allows for people with a wider range of backgrounds to dabble in a little bit of coding as well. However, my primary concern is that the generative AI will continue to make apps that look increasingly similar, leading to a lack of variety available. Additionally, as the article discusses, there is a true security concern with these apps as they lack the proper security foundation. In other words, they have a number of hidden vulnerabilities, insecure authentication processes, etc. As someone who wants to eventually venture into the computer security sector, this article raises a lot of real concerns. **Overall, the article shows that while generative AI can be helpful, using it too much can create serious security and quality problems** (Edit made my Mohamed-Mudawi)
